# Learn German

## Summary
This app was initially created in one week with [Mathew Williamson](https://github.com/mathewbwilliamson). It tests the user's
German skills by prompting them with an English word and asking for the translated word. Each user is shown a different sequence
of words, depending on how often they answer each question correctly.
